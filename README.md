4)  The problem it solves :
        To Develop a chatbot for blinds to listen the output of GEN AI by integrated into messaging platforms like OPEN AI and for voice we use platHT by using tokens and by authorization of the api keys and bot is developed by Hugging Face and by using src for embedded space for html and css and js.
    
5)  use cases:
         . The usecase to cloning of the voice as input
         . To get sustainablity in the Gen-Ai
         . To implement the new Ideas

6)  Challenges :
        The main challenges faced while developing the model is to clone the API keys to the Hugging face secrets and process of the output from text to speech and authentication of data.
